                    <p>Landscape photography commonly involves daylight photography
                    of natural features of land, sky and waters, at a distance—though some
                    landscapes may involve subjects in a scenic setting nearby,
                    even close-up, and sometimes at night.</p>

                    <p>Architectural photography is the subgenre of the photography discipline
                    where the primary emphasis is made to capturing photographs of buildings and
                    similar architectural structures that are both aesthetically pleasing and 
                    accurate in terms of representations of their subjects.</p>

                <h2>Macrophotography</h2>
                <p> Macrophotography is extreme close-up photography, usually
                of very small subjects and living organisms like insects, 
                in which the size of the subject in the photograph is greater
                than life-size (though macrophotography also refers to the art
                of making very large photographs).</p>
