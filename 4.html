                    <li>Geometric and Angular: It is known for its straight lines and right angles, creating a bold, structured look.</li>
                    <li>Used in Decoration: Often seen in architectural inscriptions, coins, and early Quran manuscripts due to its clarity and durability.</li>
                    <li>Minimal Curves: Unlike later scripts, Kufic has minimal curves and favors symmetry, making it distinct and easily recognizable.</li>

                <li>Associated with Religious Texts: Often used for Quranic manuscripts due to its beauty and readability.</li>
                <li>Soft and Rounded Style: The script has smooth curves and rounded shapes, giving it a softer appearance compared to Kufic.</li> 
                <li>Requires Precision: Writing in Rayhani requires careful attention to proportion, balance, and uniformity of letters.</li>
